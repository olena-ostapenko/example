Welcome To My World
Welcome to my world
Step right through the door
Leave your tranquilizers at home
You don't need them anymore

All the dramaqueens have gone
And the devil got dismayed
He backed up and fled this town
His masterplan delayed

And if you stay a while
I'll penetrate your soul
I'll bleed into your dreams
You'll want to lose control
I'll weep into your eyes
I'll make your vision sing
I'll open endless skies
And ride your broken wings
Welcome to my world
Welcome to my world
Welcome to my world
